# This is a WebGL App Learning Playground

Using Antipasto by Luruke, I'm going to try to replicate the engineering techniques in this case study:

#### Explaining the libraries...

WebGL apps need an event management system separated, cleaner, and encapsulated from the default DOM Event Handling system. [Bidello](https://github.com/luruke/bidello) helps manage this confusion.

WebGL apps need transpilation, loading, and code optimizations. WebPack has a lot of config so we're using [parcel-bundler](https://parceljs.org/) as our bundler. Parcel is zero-config.

Sometimes, it would be great if we could interactively manage the uniforms and attributes inside our shader. It'd be great to see more data and get an interactive view to debug shaders. [Magicshader](https://github.com/luruke/magicshader) comes in for this.

For WebGL apps, the preload phase is _extremely_ important. You need to load everything beforehand to load the textures properly throughout the entire app. [resource-loader](https://github.com/englercj/resource-loader) does this.

To help manage the interaction between DOM and JS without something heavy like jQuery, we're using [kapla](https://github.com/thierrymichel/kapla). We're mainly using Kapla for this WEbGL app because of its `MutationObserver` implementation.
